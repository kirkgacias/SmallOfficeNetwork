# CCNA: Small Office Network with Guest Access (Packet Tracer)

## Introduction
This lab models a small office network supporting three business units (Sales, Marketing, HR) plus shared server and guest segments. 
Built entirely in Cisco Packet Tracer, it uses a single ISR edge router (Router1) and a multilayer Catalyst 3560 switch to demonstrate core networking fundamentals: VLAN segmentation, DHCP provisioning, inter-VLAN routing, internet access simulation, and simple access control.

## Network Topology
In this star topology all local networks converge on the central switch for segmentation and then flow through the router for gateway and internet access.

## VLAN Segmentation & DHCP Services

Five VLANs isolate traffic by function: Sales (10), Marketing (20), HR (30), Servers (40), and Guest (50). 
Each VLAN has its own /24 subnet and gateway on Router1 subinterfaces. DHCP pools on Router1 dynamically assign addresses, with excluded ranges reserved for infrastructure. 
The Catalyst switchâ€™s trunk port carries all VLANs to the router, and access ports connect PCs and servers to their respective VLANs. This setup highlights address planning, router-on-a-stick configuration, and automated IP provisioning across multiple broadcast domains.

### PC1 Configuration:
```
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.254 (R1)
IP Address: 192.168.1.1
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
```

### PC2 Configuration:
```
Default Gateway: 192.168.3.254 (R3)
IP Address: 192.168.3.1
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
```

## Router Configurations
To configure the routers, I will first enter privileged EXEC mode using the `enable` command and then switch to global configuration mode. Next, we will set a hostname for each router and proceed to configure their interfaces. Each interface will be assigned its respective IP address, along with a description indicating its connection. Finally, we will activate the interfaces using the `no shutdown` command and repeat these steps for all interfaces.

### R1:
```
ENABLE
CONFIGURE TERMINAL
HOSTNAME R1
INTERFACE G0/1
IP ADDRESS 192.168.1.254 255.255.255.0
DESCRIPTION ## to SW1 ##
NO SHUTDOWN
INTERFACE G0/0
IP ADDRESS 192.168.12.1 255.255.255.0
DESCRIPTION ## to R2 ##
NO SHUTDOWN
```


### R2:
```
ENABLE
CONFIGURE TERMINAL
HOSTNAME R2
INTERFACE G0/0
IP ADDRESS 192.168.12.2 255.255.255.0
DESCRIPTION ## to R1 ##
NO SHUTDOWN
INTERFACE G0/1
IP ADDRESS 192.168.13.2 255.255.255.0
DESCRIPTION ## to R3 ##
NO SHUTDOWN
```

### R3:
```
ENABLE
CONFIGURE TERMINAL
HOSTNAME R3
INTERFACE G0/0
IP ADDRESS 192.168.13.3 255.255.255.0
DESCRIPTION ## to R2 ##
NO SHUTDOWN
INTERFACE G0/1
IP ADDRESS 192.168.3.254 255.255.255.0
DESCRIPTION ## to SW2 ##
NO SHUTDOWN
```

## Static Route Configuration
Since R1 and R3 are not directly connected, I must configure static routes for proper communication. R2, being an intermediate router, requires routes to both networks.
### R1 Configuration:
```
IP ROUTE 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2
```

### R2 Configuration:
```
IP ROUTE 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 G0/0
IP ROUTE 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.3
```

### R3 Configuration:
```
IP ROUTE 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.2
```

## Verification and Testing
### Check Routing Tables:
```
DO SHOW IP ROUTE
```
Each router should display the configured static routes along with directly connected routes.

### Ping Test from PC1 to PC2:
```
PING 192.168.3.1
```
The first ping may fail due to ARP resolution, but subsequent pings should succeed if configured correctly.

## Conclusion
By configuring static routes, I successfully enabled communication between PC1 and PC2 across multiple routers. This lab demonstrated fundamental routing principles essential for network engineering and CCNA certification.
